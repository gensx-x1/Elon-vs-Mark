# Elon-vs-Mark
I've been curious about experimenting with Solidity, so I created this project. While primarily intended for fun on testnets, it's designed to function on any EVM-compatible chain. Upon deployment, the contract generates two tokens, 'teamElon' and 'teamMark,' which are subsequently minted to the wallet placing a bet â€“ one token per bet.

Edit settings file before using(don't use any of your wallets, make a completely new wallet).
Deploy contract using remix and add contract address to settings 
After that run with:
>python3 ElonVsMark-Tests.py


if anyone have some questions or suggestions then hit me up on tg
