# Elon-vs-Mark
I've wanted to play around with solidity so I've made this.
It's mostly for fun on testnets but it should work on every evm chain.
On deploy this contract create two tokens(teamElon, teamMark) which are later minted for wallet that is making a bet, 1 token per bet. 

Edit settings file before using(don't use any of your wallets, make a completely new wallet).
Deploy contract using remix and add contract address to settings 
After that run with:
>python3 ElonVsMark-Tests.py


if anyone have some questions or suggestions then hit me up on tg
